# Timeless Books

A web application for readers with a twist of ML implementation.
Currently in development while finishing school, but some features of this project are:

- Ability to track what books have been read
- Ability to have collections of books (with a view of each collection available)
- Statistics for readers such as books read per month, week, year, etc.
- Implementation of a goals section for readers to hold themselves accountable
- ML section of application is proprietary as of now until project is fully implemented
